# Transportability of missing data models across study sites for research synthesis
Stata code for the simulation study to evaluate the performance of cross-site imputation in federated research settings. 
Use the current version of the ```mi_impute_from``` package (see [here](https://github.com/robertthiesmeier/mi_impute_from_version.git)). 

This repo contains: 
1. Data-generating mechanism (DGM) used in the simulation
2. All scenarios that were simulated + applied example
3. Complete datasets for all results presented in the manuscript

Improtant: a working directory and appropriate path have to be defined for the scenarios and master file.
